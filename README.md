# Data Science Portfolio

## If you're reading this...
Welcome to my humble data science portfolio which features \
many of the things I have learned over the past several months.

Back when I was an undergraduate student, I had the pleasure of \
taking many difference courses in the computer science department. \
Some of these courses were 'Principles of Computer Science,' 'Software \
Design and Implementation,' and 'Linear Algebra,' which if I'm being honest \
almost killed me - and I'm saying this as someone who grew up loving math.

Over the past five years however, I took a deep dive into the world of theology. \
It was the subject I majored in and went on to receive an M.A. in at Princeton \
Theological Seminary - specifically in Systematic Theology. It is a subject I am \
deeply passionate about and will continue to love throughout my life, as it is \
a fundamental aspect of my person and my faith.

But I always found myself coming back to tinker with Python in my spare time. \
It was something I never could quit and so I decided that I needed to pursue it \
professionally. I didn't have the skills necessary to be offered a position in an \
organization or company, so I took to Codecademy to learn many of the tools of the trade. \
I know there's so much more to learn (and I know I'll never feel like I've learned enough), \
but I love to learn and I look forward to learning more things throughout my life.

## The Projects in this Portfolio

Some of these projects come straight from the Codecademy catalogue. \
Since I have not had any professional experience in this field, I thought \
that Codecademy was a good place to start when it came learning to ask the \
right questions and begin to play around with templates and datasets.

I hope that the skills I have learned amount to, if not the most \
impressive portfolio, a collection that presents an aspiring data scientist \
with much promise and an eagerness to learn much more.

Thank you for taking the time to look over this collection.

Sincerely,
Karl Bjorkman
