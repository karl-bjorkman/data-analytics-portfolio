# Data Analytics Portfolio

## If you're reading this...
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio, which features some of the skills and tools I have been learning and practicing over the past several months.

When I was an undergraduate student at St. Olaf College (Northfield, MN), I had the opportunity to take several courses offered by the computer science department. Some of these courses were 'Principles of Computer Science,' 'Software Design and Implementation,' and 'Elementary Linear Algebra.'

Over the past five years, however, I took a deep dive into the world of theology. I received a B.A. in Religion and went on to receive an M.A. in Systematic Theology from Princeton Theological Seminary. It is a subject I am deeply passionate about and will continue to study throughout my life, as it is a fundamental aspect of my identity and faith. But I consistently found myself coming back to learn and experiment with Python in my spare time. It's a tool I've always been fascinated by and so I decided to build on my basic knowledge and see what I else I could do with it. I didn't have the necessary skills to be offered a position in a professional capacity, so I sought to complete several certifications on Codecademy to build a solid foundation of technical knowledge. I know there is so much more to learn, but this is something that only excites me as a lifelong student. I have always had an analytical mind and I hope to foster this strength in a quantitative field that thrives on teamwork and effective storytelling.

## The Projects in this Portfolio

Some of the projects featured in this portfolio have been pulled directly from the Codecademy catalogue. Since I have not had any professional experience in this field, I thought this platform was a good place to start when it came to learning to ask the right questions and begin experimenting with different datasets.

I hope that the quantitative (and qualitative) skills I have acquired over the years amount to a collection of work that shows much potential from an aspiring data analyst.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, \
Karl Bjorkman
