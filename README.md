# Data Analytics Portfolio

## If you're reading this...

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio, which features some of the technologies and skills I have been learning over the past several months. I am actively pursuing a role as a data analyst after having developed a proficiency in Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and other powerful tools. I am a scholar of theology, gifted public speaker, active listener, group leader, and fast learner. I have always had an analytical mind and I hope to foster this strength in a field that thrives on teamwork, attention to detail, and effective storytelling.

## The Projects in this Portfolio

Some of the projects featured in this portfolio have been pulled directly from the Codecademy 'Data Scientist: Analytics' Career Path catalogue. Since I do not yet have any professional experience in this field, I thought this platform was a good place to start when it came to learning how to ask the right questions and to begin examining different datasets.

I hope that the quantitative (and qualitative) skills I have acquired over the years amount to a collection of work that shows much potential from an aspiring data analyst.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, \
Karl Bjorkman
