# Data Science Portfolio

## If you're reading this...
Welcome to my data science portfolio which features \
many of the things I have been learning over the \
past several months.

Back when I was an undergraduate student, I had the opportunity to \
take several courses offered by the computer science department. \
Some of these courses were 'Principles of Computer Science,' 'Software \
Design and Implementation,' and 'Linear Algebra.'

Over the past five years, however, I took a deep dive into the world of theology. \
I received a B.A. in Religion and went on to receive an M.A. in Systematic \
Theology from Princeton Theological Seminary. It is a subject I am deeply \
passionate about and will continue to study throughout my life, as it is \
a fundamental aspect of my identity and faith.

But I always found myself coming back to tinker with Python in my spare time. \
It was a tool I could never put out of my mind and so I decided to build on my \
basic knowledge and see what I else I could do with it. I didn't have the necessary \
skills to be offered a position in an organization or company, so I sought to \
complete several certifications on Codecademy to build a solid foundation of \
technical knowledge. I know there is so much more to learn, but I plan to be \
a lifelong student regardless of the subject.

## The Projects in this Portfolio

Some of the projects featured in this portfolio come directly from the \
Codecademy catalogue. Since I have not had any professional experience \
in this field, I thought Codecademy was a good place to start when it \
came to learning to ask the right questions and to begin experimenting \
with different templates and datasets.

I hope that the skills I have acquired amount to a collection of work \
that shows much potential from an aspiring data scientist/analyst.

Thank you for taking the time to look over this collection and \
I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, \
Karl Bjorkman
