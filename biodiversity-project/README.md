# Codecademy Biodiversity Project

## Biodiversity Project walkthrough:

1. Read-in datasets and examine first five rows of each
2. Examine column datatypes in each dataset and check value counts for each variable
3. Merge datasets on 'scientific_name' of animal species (present in both datasets) to create 'master'
4. Begin investigating columns and any null values
5. Replace null values with more helpful/readable information (if necessary or appropriate)
6. Examine distribution (via bar plot) of the different conservation statuses
7. Examine only endangered species and how much of the total population they comprise
8. Make a pie chart of these proportions
9. Then, filter the master dataset to create four smaller datasets for every national park represented
10. Find the most-spotted species in each national park

### Tools used:

* Bar plots
* Pie charts
* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Basic EDA
* Imputation
