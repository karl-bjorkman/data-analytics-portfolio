# Codecademy Heart Disease Project

### Project Walkthrough:

1. Read-in dataset, separate heart disease (HD) patients from non-HD patients, and examine first five rows
2. Retrieve cholesterol levels for HD patients, then calculate the average
3. Compare the HD average to the cut-off for high cholesterol using a one-sided T-test and p-value (quantitative data)
4. Repeat this process for patients without HD
5. Next, I calculate whether or not this sample comes from a population where more than 8% of people have high fasting blood sugar (FBS > 120 mg/dl) using a Binomial test (categorical data)

### Tools used:

* One-sided T-test
* Binomial test
* P-values
