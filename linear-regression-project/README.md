# Codecademy Linear Regression Project

### Project walkthrough:

1. Write a function that calculates 'y' given 'm' (slope), 'x,' and 'b' (y-intercept)
2. Define 'calculate_error()' function that gets the absolute value of the distance between y and a y-point
3. Define a 'calculate_all_error()' function that gets the total error for a list of datapoints
4. Define and test many different slopes and y-intercepts to find which pair generates the lowest total error
5. You may then use the figures that create the lowest total error to create the line of best fit

### This is the linear regression model that provides the best predictions

> * This project is meant to reinforce the fundamentals of how a linear regression model works and is not meant to represent the most efficient way to find a line of best fit (as I'm sure there are libraries/packages that provide predefined functions)
